- Center: Tuesday night  
- Right: Wednesday night

Same location, same time, same train
Shows: Routine, predictability, vulnerability

THEN:
All three panels sync up
Train passes signal (green)
Train passes signal (green)
Train passes signal (green)

FOURTH PANEL (August 8):
Train approaches signal
Signal is RED
Train begins to brake
DIFFERENT from pattern

LIGHTING SHIFT:
- Before stop: Instrument panel glow
- After stop: Red signal light fills cab
- Bathes everything in red
- Ominous, dangerous
```

**NARRATION:**
"Every night for six months, the train passed Sears Crossing without incident. Green light. Clear track. On schedule. But the gang had studied this train. They knew its route, its timing, its crew. They knew that on August 8th, it would be carrying more money than usual. And they knew exactly where to stop it. A remote stretch of track. No witnesses. No help. Just sixty seconds from signal to ambush. That's all they needed."

---

### SCENE 8: THE SIGNAL (7:30-9:00)

**VISUAL SETUP:**
```
3D ENVIRONMENT:
- Railway signal post (tall, period accurate)
- Dark countryside
- Fog low to ground
- Signal lights: Green (top), Red (bottom)

LIGHTING - DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION:

BEFORE (7:30-8:00):
- Night scene, moonlit
- Signal glowing GREEN
- Peaceful, routine
- No people visible

THEN (8:00-8:15):
- Figures emerge from darkness (3 silhouettes)
- Carrying equipment (battery, gloves, tools)
- Lit only by moonlight (backlit)
- Faces never shown

CAMERA:

  * Hands working (close-ups, gloves)
  * Tools being used
  * Battery being connected
```

**TECHNICAL DETAIL SEQUENCE:**
```
MOTION GRAPHICS OVERLAY:

DIAGRAM ANIMATION:
Shows how they altered the signal

STEP 1: "Cover Green Light"
- Animated diagram: Glove placed over lens
- Green light still on, but not visible

STEP 2: "Power Red Light"
- Animated wiring diagram
- Battery → Red light
- False signal activated

STEP 3: "Result"
- Train sees: Red (stop)
- Reality: Track is clear
- Split screen shows deception

TIMING GRAPHIC:
"Modification Time: 12 Minutes"
"Risk Level: Extreme"
"If Discovered: Sabotage Charge"
```

**THE SWITCH:**
```
DRAMATIC MOMENT (8:30-8:45):

Close-up: Signal control box
- Wires being connected
- Switch being thrown
- GREEN LIGHT goes out
- RED LIGHT activates

CAMERA: On red light bulb itself
- Extreme close-up
- Darkness
- Then: Red glow begins
- Intensifies
- Fills frame with red

SOUND:
- Electric hum (power connecting)
- Relay clicking
- Bulb filament warming (subtle ping)
- Then: Silence (just red glow)

LIGHTING EFFECT:
Entire scene now bathed in red
Ground, fog, figures - all red
Danger, warning, point of no return
```

**WAITING:**
```
WIDE SHOT (8:45-9:00):
- Signal now showing RED
- Three figures retreat to shadows
- Hide near tracks
- Waiting

CAMERA: Locked position (no movement)
- Creates tension through stillness
- Just red light pulsing slowly
- Fog drifting
- Time passing

AUDIO:
- Wind through grass
- Distant owl
- Their breathing (quiet, nervous)
- Then... faint rumble
- Train approaching
```

**NARRATION:**
"The signal was the key. If they could stop the train here, in the middle of nowhere, they'd have time. Time to board, time to load, time to escape. The modification took twelve minutes. If a railway inspector came by, they'd be caught immediately. But at 2:45 AM on a Thursday night, no one was checking. The signal turned red. Now they just had to wait. And hope the driver didn't suspect anything."

  * Train stopped at signal
  * Silhouettes emerging from shadows
```

**NARRATION:**
"At 3:03 AM, Jack Mills brought the train to a stop. He'd been driving this route for years. A red signal was unusual, but not unheard of. Maybe track work. Maybe a fault. He sent his fireman down to check. Standard procedure. That was their first mistake."

**FINAL NARRATION:**
"Sixty years later, the Great Train Robbery remains Britain's most infamous heist. Some of the money was recovered. Most wasn't. The robbers served their time. Some died in prison. Some lived long enough to become legends. Jack Mills never got justice. The train still runs this route, carrying nothing more valuable than mail and memories. But every time it passes Sears Crossing, people remember. The night fifteen men stopped a train. The night they almost got away with it. The night that changed everything. And for what? Two point six million pounds. Which, when you calculate the cost—the years lost, the lives destroyed, the families broken—was worth absolutely nothing at all."
