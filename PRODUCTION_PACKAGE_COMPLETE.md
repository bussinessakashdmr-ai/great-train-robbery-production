## 🎬 QUICK START GUIDE

**If you want to start TODAY:**

### Hour 1: Setup
1. Install Blender (free)
2. Download storyboard frames (you have them)
3. Print or reference Frame 001 on second monitor

### Hour 2-3: First Scene
1. Open Blender, new project
2. Model simple room (Frame 004 - interrogation)
3. Add single light (overhead bulb)
4. Place camera behind chair
5. Add simple cube as "person placeholder"

### Hour 4: First Render
1. Switch to Eevee
2. Render one frame
3. Check lighting
4. Adjust
5. Repeat until looks like storyboard

### Hour 5: Victory
1. You just made your first Fern-style frame!
2. 29 more to go
3. But now you know the process
4. Each gets faster

**Repeat this process for each of the 30 storyboard frames.**

That's it. That's the whole production.

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Start with the easiest scenes first**
   - Interrogation room (simple geometry)
   - Title card (just train model)
   - Build confidence before complex scenes

2. **Reuse everything possible**
   - Same lighting rig for multiple scenes
   - Same camera animation, different scene
   - Modular props used in multiple shots

3. **Render overnight, work during day**
   - Queue renders before bed
   - Work on modeling/animation during day
   - Never waste time watching render bars

4. **Test in Eevee, final in Cycles**
   - Eevee for all tests (instant)
   - Only use Cycles for hero shots
   - Saves hundreds of hours

5. **One act at a time**
   - Complete Act 1 fully before starting Act 2
   - Feels accomplishment faster
   - Can publish in parts if needed

6. **Motion graphics can be simple**
   - Clean > flashy
   - Information > animation
   - Fern's graphics are minimalist
   - Don't overcomplicate

7. **Sound design sells it**
   - Great visuals + bad audio = amateur
   - Good visuals + great audio = professional
   - Spend time on sound

8. **Color grade makes everything cohesive**
   - Even mismatched renders look unified
   - With good grade
   - Save for last
   - Transform the piece
